1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I spent around [insert your actual time, e.g., 6–8 hours] on the coding test.

If I had more time, I would:

    Add form validation (both client-side and server-side).

    Implement image upload functionality.

    Make the UI more dynamic and polished with better transitions.

    Optimize the code structure by using reusable components and better separation of concerns (like moving inline scripts and styles to separate files).

    Improve database structure (add relationships and constraints).


2. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Yes, I’ve worked on identifying and resolving performance issues.

To track down a performance issue in production:

    Check logs – Review error logs and slow query logs.

    Use browser dev tools – For frontend issues, check network tab, rendering time, and console errors.

    Use tools like EXPLAIN – For slow MySQL queries, I analyze them using the EXPLAIN statement and add indexes where necessary.

    Monitor server performance – Check CPU, memory, and disk usage.
